# Python Practice

Hey there :)
<br/>My name is David Perelman and I would like to learn new things, and won't miss any opportunity for this!
<br/>I started to self-learn python language online, and using it to develop some mini projects in order to practice and get more experience with the language. 
<br/>


## 1. Mapping
connecting to <a href='https://data.gov.il/'> data.gov.il </a> API and getting the results of this month and year of cities in Israel with covid-19 status. 
<br/>Coloring each city in the color from the API. Connecting to openStreetMap in order to get each city's polygon in JSON form, and using it to determine city's confines.
